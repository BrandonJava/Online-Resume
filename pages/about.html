<h1>About Me:</h1>
<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>First and foremost, I am a follower of Jesus Christ. One of my biggest goals is to spread His love and kindness to needy communities. The world can always use some extra compassion and mercy with less judgment. I have a wife and two daughters. Because of this, I prefer to work from home to be an active part of their lives. My daughters are Mabel, three years old, and Lily, three months old. I have been married for almost six years, and my wife and I lead a group that helps struggling couples. I enjoy video games, board games, and card games. I am between games and waiting for Path of Exile 2 to be released. Regarding board games, Dominion is my favorite, although it is hard to choose. I am also a fan of Magic the Gathering.</p>
<h3>Work Life</h3>
<p>I have been a Web Developer for 11 years now, focusing on Java and backend systems. I have mentored many people over the years and like to periodically check in on them and see if they are successful or need any help. I am currently dabbling with more front-end development as the UI frameworks I have worked on in the past are a bit dated now. I have been in Java backend development my whole career; I enjoy programming as it fills the need to create and problem-solve uniquely. While I may only sometimes be looking for work, I am always open to hearing about opportunities. I am more than willing to suggest to others if something is a better fit for them or if I have too much on my plate.</p>
